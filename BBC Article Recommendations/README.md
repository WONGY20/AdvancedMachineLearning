# Project Introduction
In the `BBC articles recommendation` project, we utilize the [BBC data](http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html) to replicate a BBC website (not quite as pretty though!). We use an natural language processing technique word2vec to calculate the 'closeness' among articles.

# How it works
Once an user click on an article, the algorithm will find the closest 5 articles and show the article names on the right. This is a trick that many websites do in order to keep the users engaged for a longer period.
