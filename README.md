# Advanced Machine Learning Related Projects

This is a collection of ML projects that I did, the major part is credited to Prof. [Yannet Interian's](https://github.com/yanneta) USF Advanced ML course.


## [Recommender system](link1)
Build a movie rating recommendation system from scratch using collaborative filtering with matrix factorization.


## [Click-Through Rate Prediction](link2)
Use Random Forest with feature engineering to predict CTR with [Avazu data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction). Final result with Log Loss â‰ˆ 0.4.


## [Spam Classification](link3)
Use Adaboost and XGBoost methods to predict if a email is a spam with 97% accuracy rate.


## [MNIST_Neural_Net](link4)
Pytorch: implement simple 2-Layer and 3-Layer neural network using [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) to predict hand written digit with an accuracy rate = 98.29%


## [Sentiment Analysis](link5)
Use [Glove embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) on [movie review dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) of 50,000 reviews from IMDB. Predict if a review is positive or negative given the content: use XGBoost to achieve a 86.7% accuracy rate.
