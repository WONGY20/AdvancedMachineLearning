# Advanced Machine Learning Related Projects

This is a collection of ML projects that I did, topics include:
+ Regression: Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge
+ Time Series: ARIMA, SARIMA (Box-Jenkins Approach), Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters Approach), VAR, VARX (Vector Autoregression Approach) etc
+ NLP: embeddings, Tf-idf etc
+ XGBoost, Random Forest implementation
+ Neural Network, Image classification
+ Recommender System: collaborative filtering and matrix factorization

## [Here's an Ad, are you gonna click it?](CTR%20Prediction)
Use Random Forest with feature engineering to predict Click-Through Rate (CTR) with [Avazu data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction). Final result with Log Loss â‰ˆ 0.4.


## [Stop Spamming my Email!](Spam)
Use Adaboost and XGBoost methods to predict if a email is a spam with 97% accuracy rate.


## [Teach Computers to recognize Digits](NN%20MNIST%20dataset)
Pytorch: implement simple 2-Layer and 3-Layer neural network using [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) to predict hand written digit with an accuracy rate = 98.29%


## [So you watched a movie: Yay or Nay? ](Movie%20Review%20Sentiment%20Analysis)
Use [Glove embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) on [movie review dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) of 50,000 reviews from IMDB. Predict if a review is positive or negative given the content: use XGBoost to achieve a 86.7% accuracy rate.

## [How much is my House Worth?](House%20Price)
Use Linear Regression to predict the house prices in [Ames, Iowa](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). Compare regression models of OLS, Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net techniques and generate a business report.

## [BBC Article Recommendations](BBC%20Article%20Recommendations)
Replicate the recommendation system on blog-based website: provide 5 articles based on what the user is reading now using word2vec on [data](w).

## [Let's make your own Netflix recommendation engine!](Recommender%20System)
Build a movie rating recommendation system from scratch using collaborative filtering with matrix factorization.

## [Twitter Sentiment Analysis!](Twitter%20Sentiment)
I know, I know, I know. You've seen this project a million times, as a ML student, I just had to do it like everyone else :)
